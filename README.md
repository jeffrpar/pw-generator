# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

I was challenged to create the JavaScript functions necessary to create this password generator. I was given the HTML and CSS of this project as a starting point, and had to write the functions that run when the "Generate Password" button is clicked. It will first prompt the user to select the desired length of their unique password (8-128 characters). If the user enters a value outside that range, or something that is not a number, an alert will display to remind the user to enter a value between 8-128. It will then follow up with confirm windows that ask about character types. If you do not select any character types, it will alert you to select at least one character type. Once selections are made, it will push the password to the field above the "Generate Password" button.

Learning JavaScript has certainly been more of a challenge, as I had to learn to deconstruct larger problems and write out the logic of the function step-by-step using a language that is new to me.

## Usage

This password generator can be used to create a unique password by creating a string of random characters based on the user's selected criteria. Clicking the "Generate Password" button will prompt the user for criteria, and generate their unique password.
